<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Here we are in 2023, still relying on posters on campus or instagram stories to get information on what's going on around campus. Poppin' is here to change that. 
Whether you are a student looking for clubs to join or a club looking for a space to advertise, Poppin' is the perfect website for you. Gone are the days of flipping through boring stories, Poppin' is solely focused on clubs and events that are at UofT.

Here's what Poppin' Does:
* As a browser you can look through or search upcoming events and interact by leaving comments, saving the event or RSVPing to the event
* As an organizer you can post details about your event as well reply to comments/questions and view the RSVP count
* Get personalized events based on events you previously browsed

Sound like your thing? Time to find out what's Poppin'
